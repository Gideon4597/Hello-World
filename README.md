# Hello-World
I'm kinda new to programming and so far python3 is the language I know little about there are some very complicated stuff and would appreciate it if I had someone to take me through. I would like to be an ethical hacker at least part time if that is even possible,
I just like the whole concept of I.T security and there is a lot of motivation since there are the bad guys out there.
